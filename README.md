# Time_summation

This program was written to automate a routine reporting task that consisted of summing up durations of time spent working on online courses. 

It begins with a messy spreadsheet with ~50 rows for courses and 3 columns for Pre-production Time, Production Time, and Post-production time, often with multiple values in one cell. An example of such a spreadsheet is attached as Media_Production_Overview.csv. This script circumvents the difficulty of using Excel's text-to-columns function to separate each of the three columns, then individually summing each row with no way to copy the sum() formula straight down.
